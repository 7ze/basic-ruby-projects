# Caesar Cipher

A basic ruby program that implements Caesar Cipher.

## What Caesar Cipher is?

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

### Sample Result

```ruby
  encrypt("What a string!", 5)  #=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!" 
```
